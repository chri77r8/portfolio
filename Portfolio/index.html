    <!-- Description of me -->

    <section class="description">

        <p id="description-1">
            I live in Copenhagen, and have been here for 2 years.
            I'm into both website programming and connecting the visual look to some kind of database.
            I have been working at Semler Mobility in their national callcenter for a little over 1,5 years, where I
            have gotten a lot of experience in SalesForce and a good understanding of PowerBI.
            The job itself revolved around picking up calls from customers wanting to get their car booked for an
            appointment, or answering different technical questions.
            Throughout my time at Semler, I've also gotten the responsibility of training new hires, and acting as
            IT-support for everyday problems.
        </p>

        <p id="description-2">
            My hobbies are mostly spending time on my computer. Either working on some programming, or playing video
            games with friends.
            I want to work as a back-end developer in the future, with fullstack skills, and I hope my portfolio shows
            that as well :-)
        </p>

        <p id="description-3">
            I have taken an education at Svendborg HTX with teknologi A and design B as my chosen subejcts.
            While I was studying I also had work in a grocery store, and later at an IT company. Where I helped get
            computers set up for customers.
            I also did things like cleaning windows and helping dispose of industry printers.
        </p>

        <p id="description 4">
            I'm currently studying at Københavns Erhvervsakademi, where I'm taking a professionsbachelor in
            IT-arkitektur.
